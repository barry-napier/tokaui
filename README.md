This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Code Formatting

This project uses Prettier for code formatting with the tailwind-prettier-plugin to ensure consistent formatting of Tailwind CSS classes.

### Configuration

The Prettier configuration is defined in `.prettierrc` with the following key settings:

- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons at the end of statements
- 2 spaces for indentation
- 100 character line width
- Automatic sorting of Tailwind CSS classes

### Usage

Format all files:

```bash
npm run format
```

Check if files are formatted correctly:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

### VS Code Integration

For VS Code users, we recommend installing the Prettier extension and enabling "Format on Save" for the best development experience.
